        In 1244 A.D., Gangeshwar Dev, a Brahmin of "Jaitharia" clan, settled at Jaithar in Champaran.[5] One of his
        descendants, Agar Sen, acquired large territory in the reign of Emperor Jehangir and was bestowed the title of
        'Raja' by Emperor Shah Jahan. In 1659, he was succeeded by his son Raja Guj Singh, who built the palace of the
        family at Bettiah. He died in 1694 A.D. The palace stands today but serves as marketplace.

        In 1765, when the East India Company acquired the Diwani, Bettiah Raj held the largest territory under its
        jurisdiction.[6] It consisted of all of Champaran except for a small portion held by the Ram Nagar Raj (also
        held by Brahmin family).[6]

        Maharaja Sir Harendra Kishore Singh was the last king of Bettiah Raj.[5] He was born in 1854 and succeeded his
        father, the late Maharaja Rajendra Kishore Singh Bahadur in 1883. In 1884, he received the title of Maharaja
        Bahadur as a personal distinction and a Khilat and a sanad from the hands of the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal,
        Sir Augustus Rivers Thompson. He was created a Knight Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire
        on 1 March 1889. He was appointed a member of the Legislative Council of Bengal in January 1891. He was also a
        member of The Asiatic Society. He was the last ruler of Bettiah Raj. Maharaja Sir Harendra Kishore Singh Bahadur
        died heirless on 26 March 1893, leaving behind two widows, Maharani Sheo Ratna Kunwar and Maharani Janki Kunwar.
        There are a few institutions named after the queen Maharani Janki Kunwar, such as M.J.K College and M.J.K
        Hospital. The Bettiah Gharana was one of the oldest style of vocal music.[7] Madhuban was part of the erstwhile
        'Bettiah Raj'. Internal disputes and family quarrels divided the Bettiah Raj in course of time. Madhuban Raj was
        created as a consequence.
